# Interview Prep

## Credits:

> Deepak Vadgama

These are the notes I've prepared (some are collated) for my up-skilling and to refer for interviews. These include various languages and topics that I'm studying.

## How to use it?

These are study notes, mostly for revision couple of days before the interview. Check resources on each topic for more in-depth preparation.
